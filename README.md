Counter-Militarisation Mapping: Unveiling the Humanitarian Struggles of Sudan's Civilian-led Movements

Introduction:
The conflict in Sudan has claimed the lives of numerous civilians, rendering them as the forgotten victims in the midst of the military clash. In the past few years, the political discourse has been dominated by images of soldiers and insurgents, while the voices of civilian-led movements have been suppressed. Despite their valiant humanitarian efforts, these actors have been overlooked in battlefield mapping, leaving their contributions to Sudan's political narrative underrepresented.

Project Description:
The Counter-Militarisation Mapping project seeks to redefine the Sudan conflict by bringing the voices of civilians to the forefront. By leveraging open-source investigation tools, the project will create an alternative type of mapping that represents the experiences and struggles of Sudan's civilian-led movements. These maps will showcase the humanitarian work of these actors, including the provision of basic necessities such as food and medicine to those affected by the conflict. Additionally, the project will highlight the locations of crucial infrastructure that are at risk of damage or destruction, helping to predict the falling of civilian infrastructure and building future responses for future crises.

Political Statement:
The Counter-Militarisation Mapping project is a political statement that challenges the dominant narrative of the Sudan conflict. By foregrounding the experiences of civilian-led movements, the project aims to shift the focus from military-centric news towards the humanitarian efforts of these actors. Through mapping and visual representation, the project asserts the importance of non-combatant actors in the Sudan conflict, subverting the conventional portrayal of the conflict as a two-party war.

Artistic Expression:
The maps created by the Counter-Militarisation Mapping project will be more than just tools for analysis; they will be expressions of the lived experiences of Sudan's civilian-led movements. By collaborating with artists and designers, the project aims to create a visually striking representation of the realities of life in Sudan. Through this artistic expression, the project hopes to inspire empathy and awareness for the humanitarian struggles of Sudan's civilians, amplifying their voices and giving them due recognition.
